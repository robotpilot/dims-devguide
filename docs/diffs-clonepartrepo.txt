+Creating a new repo from portions of an existing repo
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+If you want to fork just part of an existing Git repo (e.g., just a single
+subdirectory in a larger repo) to use that as the foundation for a new project,
+follow these references to use ``git subtree``:
+
+    * `fun with git: making a subdirectory into a new repository`_
+
+    * `Detach subdirectory into separate Git repository`_ (The Easy Way)
+
+.. _fun with git\: making a subdirectory into a new repository: http://alyssafrazee.com/popping-a-subdirectory.html
+.. _Detach subdirectory into separate Git repository: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359424/detach-subdirectory-into-separate-git-repository/17864475#17864475
+
+Alternatively, if you need all of a forked repo `except` for one
+or more directories, ``git filter-branch`` may be more appropriate.

+    Add ``code-block::`` examples of doing this with a real repo
+    (e.g., ``demoapp`` from `openstack/cliff`_.)
